      "description": "The real-estate-financing.html prototype fails to scrape property data from immobilien.derstandard.at. The CSS selectors don't match the actual DOM structure.\n\nREQUIRED FIXES:\n- Address: Use .heading-section-address instead of .object-location\n- Price/Area/Rooms: Use .sc-stat with .sc-stat-label and .sc-stat-value pattern\n- Image: Extract from picture > source srcset attribute (not img src)\n\nSee attached specification (real_estate_scraper_fix.md) for complete implementation details and code examples. Also uploaded to the server at /var/www/smartprototypes.net/public_html/UI_Prototypes/Banking_Prototypes/real_estate_scraper_fix.md\n\nTest URL: https://immobilien.derstandard.at/detail/15006491",

Each tier requires 7 sparefroh batches which are either shown active or inactive\n2. make clear that user needs to do to gain further batches. Highlighting the next best action or viewing all measures to fill batches within the tier \n3. I\u2019m not yet happy with the visual of the batches. I really need a icon showing the \u201esparefroh\u201c which I uploaded you in previous requirement. Find ways to illustrate the sparefroh as icon within the batches. ",

Let me choose competition FIFA World Cup 2026 and later I would like to choose Austria as my Favorite Club. Later you choose how much you want to save when your club scores a goal. And which target account the amount should be deposited on. Finally you get a confirmation screen summarising the rule and then if the club scores you get a emotional push notification. Iterate this with your senior designers and come up with a functional html prototype ",
